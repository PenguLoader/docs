## Troubleshooting

- For Windows 8.1/10 clean install, you should install
  [VC++ 2015-2019](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
  runtime
- Do not put any files from the tool in the 'League of Legends' or 'Riot Client'
  folder
- Before removing the portable version, you must first deactivate it
